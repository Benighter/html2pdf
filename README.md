- Vanilla JavaScript
- Font Awesome icons
- Google Fonts

## 📋 Best Practices for HTML Conversion

For optimal PDF conversion results:

- Include complete HTML structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
- Use standard CSS that works across most browsers
- For custom styling, include CSS within `<style>` tags in the `<head>`
- External resources like images should use absolute URLs
- Keep the document structure simple for the best layout results

## 🛠️ Development

This project follows a clean, modular architecture approach:

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - All styling with variables for theming
- `js/` - Modular JavaScript files

### JavaScript Architecture

The JavaScript code is organized into separate modules following the separation of concerns principle:

- `js/main.js` - Entry point for the application
- `js/app.js` - Main application controller
- `js/config.js` - Configuration settings and constants
- `js/dom.js` - DOM element references
- `js/theme.js` - Theme management (dark/light mode)
- `js/ui.js` - UI helper functions
- `js/htmlProcessor.js` - HTML validation and formatting
- `js/pdfConverter.js` - PDF conversion logic

Each module has a single responsibility and clear interfaces, making the code more maintainable, testable, and extensible.
