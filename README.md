## üìã Best Practices for HTML Conversion

For optimal PDF conversion results:

- Include complete HTML structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
- Use standard CSS that works across most browsers
- For custom styling, include CSS within `<style>` tags in the `<head>`
- External resources like images should use absolute URLs
- Keep the document structure simple for the best layout results

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

This project follows a clean architecture approach:

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - All styling with variables for theming
- `script.js` - Core application functionality

### Code Structure

- **Config & Constants**: Application configuration settings
- **DOM Elements**: References to HTML elements
- **Theme Management**: Dark/light mode functionality
- **UI Helpers**: Functions for UI manipulation
- **HTML Processor**: Validation and formatting of HTML
- **PDF Conversion**: Conversion logic (currently a stub)
- **Main App Controller**: Core application workflow
